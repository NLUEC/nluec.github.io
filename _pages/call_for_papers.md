<h2>Call for Papers</h2>

We invite submissions of original contributions on theories and applications of natural language processing and understanding and machine learning methods to interpret and understand from enterprise corpora. The scope of the workshop includes, but is not limited to, the following areas:

- Named-entity recognition, coreference resolution, relation extraction and semantic role labeling for business corpora such as industrial reports and news, financial filings, legal documents and product reviews;
- Semantic representation learning such as vectors and embeddings from business corpora;
- Event detection and profiling;
- Knowledge extraction and discovery;
- Automatic knowledge base population and completion;
- Dialogue system and chatbot, voice interface design for NLU;
- Question answering applications in the enterprise domain; 
- NLU applications to tasks such as automated reasoning, text classification, sentiment analysis, content analysis, search engines, open-set information retrieval to support business decisions.

We encourage submissions to relate their research to common challenges and opportunities in the business domain, such as:
- How their research contributes to business strategy, operations, or decision making;
- How they tackle common problems that arise in the business domain, including but not limited to:
* Low signal to noise ratio: How they filter noisy data, boiler-plate language and other low-signal content;
* Scarcity of gold labels: How they generate noisy, distant or synthetic labels, or use unsupervised, semi-supervised or transfer learning to tackle this problem;
- Task ambiguity: How they design models that learn fuzzy, unclear or evolving tasks;
- High performance expectations: How they optimize performance in tackling the precision and recall tradeoff.
