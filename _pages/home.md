<h2>Introduction</h2>

Natural language understanding (NLU) from enterprise corpora has gained remarkable attention over the last few years. Enterprise corpora are datasets that are generated by, or curated for the purpose of supporting business operations. There is also a wide variety of enterprise corpora to consider including, but not limited to, legal contracts, reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, loan documents, market data, product reviews, customer feedback records, business call transcripts as well as news articles and social media posts about a company. Because of huge business values embedded in these corpora, companies look to invest in resources that will help them effectively analyze the growing volume of enterprise data. 
 
The volume, domain, semantic complexity, and structural integrity of the enterprise corpora largely depend on their application within the business, but very commonly some level of subject matter expertise is required to process them properly. For example, financial analysts analyze management presentations to extract a company’s earnings and expenses in an effort to evaluate the expected return on equity investments. Lawyers thoroughly research case histories to find potentially relevant arguments. Sales teams use customer feedbacks and call transcripts to help senior management to refine companies’ business strategies. The key information and signals in these corpora can have critical impacts to various decisions of business operations.
 
Human analysis of enterprise corpora is often complicated by the pressure to deliver detailed and accurate insights in a timely manner. Many companies employ large teams to process immense pools of documents. But making timely business decisions sometimes depends on an almost spontaneous comprehension of, and reaction to the signal, which is impossible with manual analysis.  The documents and analysis requirements can constantly evolve, further complicating human oversight. Additionally, as the volume of unstructured data grows at a nearly exponential rate, the manual approach becomes increasingly unsustainable. 
 
With the recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms and systems, the accuracy and speed of many natural language processing tasks have tremendously improved. Reacting to this wave, business operations have tapped into their power to automate the understanding of formal (or informal) language in business contexts. But in order to uncover critical information and signals from large-scale corpora to support important business decisions, academic researchers and industry practitioners encounter unprecedent challenges in designing competent natural language understanding and processing algorithms and systems. Some of challenges include the complexity of language itself in specialized documents such as contracts and other legal documents, low signal to noise ratio in long documents such as loan agreements, fastidious precision and recall requirements to support key business decisions.    
 
These challenges and also prospects call for new natural language understanding techniques and systems to help in the automated processing of unstructured corpora for signals and insights. The nuanced and complex nature of these NLU problems require the joint collaboration of academic researchers and industry practitioners to meet these enterprise stipulations.
